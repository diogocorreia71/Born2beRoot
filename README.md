<p>"This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules."</p>

<p>I followed gemartins's tutorial: https://github.com/gemartin99/Born2beroot-Tutorial</p>
<p>I also followed Joao's alternative tips on some aspects of the tutorial: https://github.com/jpjpcs/42_born2beroot</p>

<p>The main change that I made in my VM was the display of the script. The project subjects states that "at server startup, the script will display some information on all terminals every 10 minutes".</p>
<p>By adding "*/10 * * * * bash /home/user/monitoring.sh" to the crontab file, this instructs cron to display the script at every minute 10th minute of the hour (ex: 09:10, 09:20, 09:30).</p>
<p>To fix this, I created a second script to delay the display taking into account the server startup time.</p>
